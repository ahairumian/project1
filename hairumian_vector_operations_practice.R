# Your task is to calculate BMI for given weight/height data
# BMI is calcualted by the following formula: BMI = Weight (Kilograms) / Height^2 (Meters)

weight_pound <- c(135,165,132,186) #Weight in Pounds
height_centimeter <- c(155, 172, 150, 182) # Height in centimeters

# Make sure to convert the given values to appropriate units
# For your reference: 1 Kilogram = 2.2 Pounds; 1 meter = 100 centimeters
# Fill in the rest
